# AR-VR-INTERFACE-DESIGN

**Introduction**

ROOM360XR is an immersive AR-VR mobile application designed to revolutionize the way users visualize and interact with interior spaces. The app enables users to experience real-time 3D room customization, furniture placement, and virtual walkthroughs before making any purchase or renovation decisions.

This project was inspired by the need to bridge the gap between imagination and reality, allowing users to see how furniture and décor would fit in their space using AR-VR technology. I designed this app in Figma, focusing on an intuitive user experience, seamless navigation, and a visually appealing interface to make AR-VR experiences more accessible.

**How I Created the Design**

1. Research & Problem Identification
Before designing ROOM360XR, I conducted extensive user research to understand pain points in the home décor and real estate industries. My research included:

User Interviews – Talking to homeowners, interior designers, and furniture buyers to identify challenges in spatial visualization.
Market Research – Analyzing competitors like IKEA Place, Houzz, and AR Home Design to understand AR-VR trends.
Pain Points Identified:
Users struggle to visualize how furniture will look in their space.
Traditional 2D shopping experiences lack real-world perspective.
AR-VR apps are often complex and not user-friendly.
Based on these insights, I designed ROOM360XR to offer a simplified, engaging, and realistic virtual room visualization experience.

2. Wireframing & UI/UX Design in Figma
After defining the key features, I created low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to plan the app layout. My focus was on:

A clean and intuitive home screen with AR scan and VR walkthrough options.
A guided onboarding process to help first-time users understand AR-VR features.
A real-time camera integration page allowing users to place furniture in their environment.
Once the wireframes were finalized, I moved to high-fidelity UI design, ensuring a modern, minimalistic, and user-friendly interface. I also created an interactive prototype to simulate AR-VR interactions for usability testing.

3. Tools & Technologies Used
To bring ROOM360XR’s design to life, I used:
Figma – For wireframing, UI design, and prototyping.
Material Design & Apple HIG – To ensure a consistent and accessible design system.

4. Key Features & Improvements
Immersive AR-VR Room Customization

Users can scan their room with AR and place 3D furniture models in real-time.
A 360-degree VR mode allows virtual walkthroughs of customized spaces.
Enhanced E-Commerce Integration

Direct links to furniture stores, allowing users to purchase items instantly.
A wishlist feature to save preferred products for later.
Personalized & AI-Powered Recommendations

AI suggests furniture styles based on user preferences and room dimensions.
Users can upload room images for AI-driven décor suggestions.
Optimized for Mobile Performance

Adaptive UI for various screen sizes with dark mode support.
Ensured smooth AR rendering without performance lags.

5. Where This Platform is Applicable
ROOM360XR has wide-ranging applications, including:

Furniture & Home Décor Shopping – Helping users visualize products before purchase.
Interior Design & Architecture – Assisting designers in presenting ideas to clients.
Real Estate & Property Tours – Allowing virtual walkthroughs for property buyers.
Gaming & Virtual Experiences – Expanding into 3D modeling and metaverse applications.

6. Challenges & Learnings
Some challenges I faced during the design process included:

Balancing usability and AR complexity – Ensuring that the AR-VR interface is simple for non-tech users.
Performance considerations – Optimizing UI to handle high-quality 3D models without lag.
Ensuring accessibility – Making the app usable for visually impaired users with voice and gesture controls.
Through this project, I enhanced my skills in designing for emerging technologies, creating intuitive UI for AR-VR, and optimizing mobile user experiences.

Conclusion
ROOM360XR is a game-changing AR-VR mobile app that makes room visualization effortless. With a strong focus on user experience, immersive design, and seamless shopping integration, it can transform how users design their spaces.

This project showcases my UI/UX expertise, problem-solving skills, and ability to design for future technologies like AR and VR.
